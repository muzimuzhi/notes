## TeX Live

* [SVN repo](https://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/), [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source)
* [Historic images](ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/texlive/)
* Latest package files (compressed) [distributed by CTAN mirrors](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive)

### `tlmgr` Usages

* Show list of request type
  ```bash
  # list of schemes
  $ tlmgr info schemes

  # list of collections
  $ tlmgr info collections

  # list of all packages
  $ tlmgr info
  ```
   - With option `--only-installed`, only installed items are shown.
* Show contents of specific item
  ```bash
  # list contents of specified package
  $ tlmgr info --list <pkg-name>

  # list contents of specified scheme
  # e.g., tlmgr info --list scheme-medium
  $ tlmgr info --list <scheme-name>

  # list contents of specified collection
  $ tlmgr info --list <collection-name>
  ```
* Set `max_print_line` (see explanations in [texstudio-org/texstudio#325 (comment)](https://github.com/texstudio-org/texstudio/issues/325#issuecomment-649918868))
  ```bash
  # show
  tlmgr conf texmf max_print_line

  # set
  tlmgr conf texmf max_print_line 2000

  # delete
  tlmgr conf texmf --delete max_print_line
  ```
* Get space separated list of installed packages (use GNU `ggrep` for its `-P` option):
  ```bash
  $ tlmgr list --only-installed | ggrep -oP '(?<=i )\w+(?=:)' | tr '\n' ' '
  ```

  * `Full name > Family-Style > PostScript name > Family`
  * To let XeTeX auto-load variations, `Family` is recommended
* Show font info: `aat-info.tex` and `opentype-info.tex`, located in `$TEXMFDIST/tex/xetex/xetexfontinfo`

## dvipdfm-x

* Config file: `dvipdfmx.cfg`, located in
    ```bash
    kpsewhich --progname=dvipdfmx --format=othertext [-all] dvipdfmx.cfg
    ```
* Set single letter command line options from inside tex file: `\special{dvipdfmx:config <opt> <val>}`.
    * Example: Use `\special{dvipdfmx:config C 0x0010}` to not optimize PDF destinations. (option `-C` is documented in `texdoc dvipdfmx`, sec. 6.1)

## MiKTeX - A LaTeX Distribution

## TeX in Other Programming Languages

### JavaTeX Project, by Timothy Murphy

An introduction to this Project is published on [1999 TUGboat](https://www.tug.org/TUG99-web/pdf/murphy.pdf). This project is also uploaded to CTAN as a package [named `javatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/javatex?lang=en). The performance is so poor that the author "considers it unusable in practice", by its readme on CTAN.

## Journal

[The PracTeX Journal](http://tug.org/pracjourn/2012-1/toc.html), the online journal of the TeX Users Group, has published [20 issues](http://tug.org/pracjourn/archive.html) from 2005 to 2012.
