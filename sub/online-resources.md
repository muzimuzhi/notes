# LaTeX - Online Resources

Here is a personal list of helpful online resources out of the CTAN (ctan.org) but all about (La)TeX and its friends.

## Must Know Sites

* [CTAN](https://ctan.org/) (The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network)<br />
  Like CPAN (P stands for "Perl") and CRAN (R stands for programming language "R"), CTAN is a central place for all kinds of material around TeX.
* Q & A sites
  * [TeX - LaTeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com), nicknamed as TeX-SX
  * [LaTeX Community](https://latex.org/forum/), a somewhat more traditional site
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online editor, compiler, and project manager<br />
  Overleaf has joint forces with [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/) since Jun 2017, and the two sites now provide the same service, called overleaf v2.

## Online Documentations

### Short Guides

For basic uses, some guidelines of MathJax can be a good learning resource of LaTeX math formula.

* (MathJax Guides) [LaTeX math in less than 10 minutes](http://math-on-quora.surge.sh/) shows juicy examples, both  carefully classified and interactively displayed, made with love by Quora user [Gilles](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gilles-Castel-1).
* (MathJax Guides) [MathJax basic tutorial and quick reference](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/) from Mathematics Stack Exchange, provides more complete reference as well as more complex examples.

### FAQ

* [The TeX Frequently Asked Question List](https://texfaq.org/), used to be the UK FAQ

### Full-Length Books

* [Dickimaw's 3-volume LaTeX books](https://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/)
